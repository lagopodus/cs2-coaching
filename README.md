# CS2 Pro Coaching (Demo Site)

Welcome to my one-page hype machine. I built this site to show off what it would look like if I were selling outrageous, ultra-premium Counter-Strike 2 coaching—and yes, it's still entirely fictional.

## What I'm claiming to do here (even though it's pretend)
- **Hero and positioning**: I'm pitching myself as the secret weapon who can skyrocket your aim, game sense, and clutch consistency, talking like I can make you a totally different player overnight.
- **Package highlights**: I showcase three over-the-top packages (Aim Warmup, Strat Architect, Team Bootcamp) with bold promises, stacked bonuses, and calls to action that make it feel like you have to book right now.
- **Perks and stats**: I flex bilingual coaching, downloadable drills, 24/7 support, and dramatic-but-made-up performance boosts to sell the dream as hard as possible.
- **Curriculum outline**: I map out a pretend curriculum covering mechanics, utility mastery, IGL-level calling, and post-session follow-up—like I'm covering every gap you have.
- **Social proof**: I parade glowing testimonials with star ratings to make it seem like players level up absurdly fast under my guidance.
- **Booking form**: I include a non-functional booking form so you can "lock in" your spot with your name, contact info, preferred package, and schedule—just for show.
- **FAQ section**: I answer the usual pre-booking questions about language, solo vs. team sessions, post-session materials, and how "fast" I can turn you into a highlight reel.
- **Branding footer**: I cap it off with a confident footer to hammer home the promise that I'm about to make you a much stronger player.

## Development
The app is built with Create React App. Useful scripts:
- `npm start` — Run the dev server at http://localhost:3000.
- `npm test` — Launch tests in watch mode.
- `npm run build` — Produce a production build.
- `npm run eject` — Copy configuration out of Create React App (one-way operation).

This repository is for demonstration purposes only; no real coaching service is provided.
