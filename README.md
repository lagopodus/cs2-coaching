# CS2 Pro Coaching (Demo Site)

This project is a single-page marketing site that pretends to sell ultra-premium coaching sessions for Counter-Strike 2 players and teams. Every section is written like a top-tier coach promising to make you feel a million times sharper, faster, and more confident in-game—while remaining entirely fictional.

## What the site is doing (is pretending to do)
- **Hero and positioning**: Pitches "CS2 Pro Coaching" as the secret weapon for skyrocketing your aim, IQ, and clutch consistency with a seasoned coach claiming near-miraculous improvement.
- **Package highlights**: Showcases three mock packages (Aim Warmup, Strat Architect, Team Bootcamp) with bold promises, value stacks, and irresistible calls to action.
- **Perks and stats**: Features over-the-top perks (bilingual coaching, downloadable drills, 24/7 support) and dramatic—but made-up—performance boosts to sell the dream.
- **Curriculum outline**: Maps out a pretend curriculum covering mechanics, utility mastery, IGL-level calling, and post-review follow-up so you feel like every gap is covered.
- **Social proof**: Displays glowing testimonials with star ratings to imply players rapidly level up under this coach.
- **Booking form**: Includes a non-functional booking form to "lock in" your spot by collecting name, contact, preferred package, and scheduling details.
- **FAQ section**: Answers common pre-booking questions about language, solo vs. team sessions, post-session materials, and how "fast" you can become a highlight reel.
- **Branding footer**: Finishes with a confident footer to reinforce the brand and its promise of turning you into a much stronger player.

## Development
The app is built with Create React App. Useful scripts:
- `npm start` — Run the dev server at http://localhost:3000.
- `npm test` — Launch tests in watch mode.
- `npm run build` — Produce a production build.
- `npm run eject` — Copy configuration out of Create React App (one-way operation).

This repository is for demonstration purposes only; no real coaching service is provided.
