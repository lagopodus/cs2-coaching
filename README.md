# CS2 Pro Coaching (Demo Site)

This project is a single-page marketing site that pretends to sell coaching sessions for Counter-Strike 2 players and teams. It showcases fictional offers, curriculum highlights, community reviews, and a simple booking form to illustrate how a premium coaching service might be presented online.

## What the site is doing (is pretending to do)
- **Hero and positioning**: Presents "CS2 Pro Coaching" as a specialist coach offering weekly EU slots for individuals and teams.
- **Package highlights**: Lists three mock packages (Aim Warmup, Strat Architect, Team Bootcamp) with prices, benefits, and call-to-action buttons.
- **Perks and stats**: Shows fictional perks (bilingual coaching, downloadable drills, support access) and stat cards with impressive but made-up performance boosts.
- **Curriculum outline**: Breaks down a pretend coaching curriculum covering mechanics, utility, calling, and post-review follow-up.
- **Social proof**: Displays sample testimonials with star ratings to imply happy customers.
- **Booking form**: Includes a non-functional booking form to collect name, contact, preferred package, and scheduling details.
- **FAQ section**: Answers common pre-booking questions about language, solo vs. team sessions, and post-session materials.
- **Branding footer**: Finishes with a lightweight footer to reinforce the brand and contact presence.

## Development
The app is built with Create React App. Useful scripts:
- `npm start` — Run the dev server at http://localhost:3000.
- `npm test` — Launch tests in watch mode.
- `npm run build` — Produce a production build.
- `npm run eject` — Copy configuration out of Create React App (one-way operation).

This repository is for demonstration purposes only; no real coaching service is provided.
